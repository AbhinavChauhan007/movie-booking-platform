This project is a production-grade, scalable backend system for a Movie Ticket Booking Platform, designed using Spring Boot, Spring Security, clean architecture, and distributed systems principles.

The system is intentionally built to mirror real-world enterprise platforms (BookMyShow / Netflix-style backend thinking), focusing not only on functionality but on:

Scalability

Extensibility

Fault tolerance

Clean separation of responsibilities

Infrastructure-aware design

The project evolves module-by-module, simulating how large systems are designed, scaled, and refactored in real companies.
